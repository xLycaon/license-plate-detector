# License Plate Detector üöóüîç

## üìñ Overview

This project is a **License Plate Detection** and **Recognition** system that utilizes **OpenCV** to detect and recognize vehicle license plates in images. It is designed for **automatic number plate recognition (ANPR)** applications, which can be useful in scenarios like **traffic monitoring** or **vehicle identification**.

The project comes with a **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** to make the user experience easier and more intuitive.

## üéØ Features

- **License Plate Detection**: Automatically detects license plates in various vehicle images.
- **Character Recognition**: Extracts and recognizes alphanumeric characters from detected license plates using custom recognition algorithms.
- **Multiple Image Formats**: Supports common image formats such as `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, and `.png`.
- **GUI Interface**: The project includes a GUI to display images and provide feedback on the detection process.
- **Easy to Set Up and Run**: Simple compilation process using **CMake**.
