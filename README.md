# License Plate Detector üöóüîç

## üìñ Overview

This project is a **License Plate Detection** and **Recognition** system that utilizes **OpenCV** to detect and recognize vehicle license plates in images. It is designed for **automatic number plate recognition (ANPR)** applications, which can be useful in scenarios like **traffic monitoring** or **vehicle identification**.

The project comes with a **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** to make the user experience easier and more intuitive.

## üéØ Features

- **License Plate Detection**: Automatically detects license plates in various vehicle images.
- **Character Recognition**: Extracts and recognizes alphanumeric characters from detected license plates using custom recognition algorithms.
- **Multiple Image Formats**: Supports common image formats such as `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, and `.png`.
- **GUI Interface**: The project includes a GUI to display images and provide feedback on the detection process.
- **Easy to Set Up and Run**: Simple compilation process using **CMake**.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

### 1. **Clone the Project**

Start by cloning this repository to your local machine:

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/xLycaon/license-plate-detector.git
  ```

### 2. **Download Libraries**

- Click on the link above to download the required libraries.
- **Unzip** the downloaded contents into the root directory of this project.
- After unzipping the libraries, you will find a collection of `.dll` files within the unzipped folder.
- **Copy** all the `.dll` files from the libraries folder and **paste them** into the `out` folder (or build output folder) when building the project.
  
### 3. **Set Up Your Environment**

- Install a **C++ compiler** appropriate for your system.
- Install **CMake** if you don‚Äôt have it already.

### 4. **Build the Project**
- **Open a terminal/command prompt** and navigate to the project folder.
- Create a **build directory** and move into it:
  ```bash
  mkdir build
  cd build
  ```
### 5.Run CMake to generate the necessary build files:

  ```bash
  cmake ..
  ```

### 6.Compile the Project:

  ```bash
  make
  ```
This will compile the project and create an executable in the build directory.
